## EJS Functions & Features
**EJS (Embedded JavaScript)** is used to dynamically render content on the server side, making it easier to display variables, loops, and conditional statements inside HTML templates.

### Key EJS features:
- **Template Rendering:** EJS allows you to embed JavaScript directly into HTML, making it simple to inject dynamic data.
- **Partial Views:** You can include parts of HTML templates (like footers, headers) using `<%- include('footer') %>`, promoting code reusability.
- **Loops & Conditional Statements:** Use loops (`<% for(...) %>`) and conditionals (`<% if(...) %>`) to create dynamic content that reacts to the data you have.
